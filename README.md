# 📚 DSA Solutions

Daily Data Structures and Algorithms practice in C++, with problem links, explanations, and time/space complexity.

This repository is organized by topic (arrays, linked list, binary search, etc.) and contains clean, well-structured solutions for LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks problems.

## 🧩 Structure

dsa-solutions/
├─ arrays/
├─ linked_list/
└─ ...

Each folder contains `.cpp` files for DSA problems with:

- Problem name  
- Problem link  
- Approach  
- Time complexity  
- Space complexity  
- Explanation (in comments)

---

## 🔥 What I’m Currently Working On

- Solving 1–3 LeetCode/GFG problems **daily**
- Writing clean, readable solutions in C++
- Maintaining consistent commit history
- Learning Git & GitHub workflow

---

## ✨ Topics Covered So Far

- Arrays  
- Linked List  
- Binary Search  
- Two Pointers  
- Recursion *(coming soon)*

*(The list will grow as I progress.)*

## 🧠 Sample Problem Format

```cpp
// Problem: <Problem Name>
// Link: <LeetCode/GFG URL>
// Approach: <Short explanation>
// Time Complexity: O(..)
// Space Complexity: O(..)

/*
Explanation:
<2–5 lines explaining the logic>
*/

class Solution {
public:
    // code here
};
```
## 🚀 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
